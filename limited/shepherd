Whenever a player is herded by the Shepherd they are added to the herded channel, here the Shepherd can anonymously talk with herded players.
Herded players cannot be killed, instead they will become unherded, neither can the Shepherd be killed by herded players.
Herded players are informed they are Herded.
At the end of each night the Shepherd is informed of everyone who is herded and Unherded that phase.

The Shepherd is able to herd 1 player for every 15 players in the game (rounded). They may not herd a member of the flock team or channel
The amount of players used is the amount of players that are apart of the game, not alive players.

The Shepherd will work together with any herding dogs, they will all be part of a flock channel where they can communicate securely.
If the Shepherd loses their role, they will lose their ability to herd players. Role changes are not revealed to the other Flock Team members.
