**Shepherd** | Solo Power - Flock Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Shepherd may Herd one player (for every 15 players rounded). When everyone is dead, herded or part of the flock team the Shepherd wins.

When a player is herded by the shepherd they are added to the Herded channel, here the Shepherd can anonymously talk with Herded players
Herded players cannot be killed, instead they will become unherded, neither can the Shepherd be killed by herded players
Herded players are informed they are Herded
At the end of each night the Shepherd is informed of everyone who is Herded and Unherded that phase
