**Greater Coyote** | Werewolf Killing

__Basics__
The Greater Coyote acts as a regular member of the coyotes except if the Greater Coyote dies the coyotes lose their abilities and their kill, instead all remaining coyotes join the wolfpack
__Details__
If the wolfpack fails to kill a townsfolk on any given night the Greater Coyote gives the coyotes the ability to kill on the next night.
When the Greater Coyote dies the coyotes are disbanded  removing the coyotes ability to gain a kill and all coyotes with abilities lose them, all alive coyotes then join the wolfpack.
If the Greater Coyote loses their role, the coyotes continues to exist, until the original Greater Coyote dies.
Any member of the coyotes, who no longer has their original role, can still vote on who to attack.
The coyotes decides their victims by voting on whom they suspect most. The coyotes' attack is an end-night ability.

__Simplified__
The Greater Coyote shares a secret channel with the other coyotes.
If the pack fails to kill a towsfolk, the coyotes can vote to attack one player the next night. 
When the Greater Coyote dies, the coyoteslose their abilities and are disbanded, instead joining the wolfpack.
